## üöÄ Get Started in Minutes!

### 1. Download StayActive

Choose the correct version for your Mac's chip:

* **[Download for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 Macs)](https://github.com/zeeshan1112/StayActive/releases/latest/download/StayActive_1.0.1_AppleSilicon.dmg)**
* **[Download for Intel Mac](https://github.com/zeeshan1112/StayActive/releases/latest/download/StayActive_1.0.1_Intel.dmg)**

> üí° **Not sure which chip your Mac has?**
> Click the **Apple menu** (Ô£ø) in the top-left corner of your screen and choose **"About This Mac."** Look for "Chip" or "Processor."

### 2. Install & Initial Launch

1.  Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag **StayActive.app** to your Applications folder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **First Launch Warning (Gatekeeper):**
> The first time you launch StayActive, macOS Gatekeeper might prevent it from opening because the app is downloaded from the internet and not from the Mac App Store.
>
> To bypass this:
> 1.  **Try opening directly:**
>     * **Right-click** (or Control-click) on **StayActive.app** in your Applications folder.
>     * Select **"Open"** from the context menu.
>     * A dialog box should appear with an **"Open"** button. Click it to confirm.
> 2.  **If the "Open" button is not present in the dialog:**
>     * Go to **System Settings** (or System Preferences).
>     * Click on **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar.
>     * In the "Security" section at the top, you should see a message about "StayActive" being blocked. Click the **"Open Anyway"** button next to this message. You'll likely be prompted to confirm again.
>
> You should only need to do this bypass once.

### 3. Grant Essential Permissions

For StayActive to function correctly and seamlessly, you need to grant it **Accessibility permission**. This allows it to perform the subtle mouse movements that keep your Mac active.

2.  Click on **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar.
3.  Scroll down and click on **Accessibility**.
4.  You may need to click the **unlock icon** in the bottom left corner and enter your administrator password.
5.  In the list, find **"StayActive."**
    * If it's there, ensure its checkbox is **ticked (enabled)**.
    * If it's *not* there, click the **`+` (plus) button**, navigate to your `/Applications` folder, select **"StayActive.app"**, and click **"Open"**. Then, make sure its checkbox is **ticked**.
6.  Close System Settings.
7.  If StayActive was already running, **restart the app** from your menu bar for the changes to take effect.

#### Allowing Notifications (Optional)

StayActive can send simple notifications to inform you when it starts and stops.

1.  Go to **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**).
2.  Click on **Notifications**.
3.  Scroll down to **"StayActive"** in the app list.
4.  Click on it and adjust its notification settings to your preference (e.g., enable "Allow Notifications," choose "Banners" or "Alerts").
